        * The new release of Cibyl has changed the System.currentTimeMillis()
        definition, fix the vGetTickCount() to match that (but still be more
        like the Mophun version)

	* Fixed the build system to match that of newer versions of Cibyl

	* A bug in the lorminator dash example that prohibited placing of
	bombs in some occations was fixed. It was really just a typo...
